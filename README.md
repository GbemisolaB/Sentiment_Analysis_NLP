# Sentiment_Analysis_NLP


Collaborated with colleges to build a sentiment prediction application using Natural Language Processing (NLP) in python. Data containing both negative and positive sentiments was used to train the machine to be able to make predictions about future reviews. Steps taken to build the application includes importing the datasets, importing nltk to process the data and build the model, processing the data by removing stopwords, punctuations, tokenizing the data, fitting the model to the various ML algorithms, including deep learning LSTM.
